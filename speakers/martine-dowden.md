Focusing on web interfaces that are beautiful, functional, and usable, Martine delivers products that adhere to WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 for accessibility and compliance. She approaches User Experience from both Art and Science, drawing from her degrees in Psychology and Visual Communications. Martine has worked as an artist, educator, and consultant since 2005.

She stays active in the industry, teaching new developers at Eleven Fifty Academy, attending and speaking at conferences and meetups, and publishing the occasional blog. In 2015 Martine's children's book "Programming Languages ABC++" was published by Inedo, and in 2016 the Workbook Edition sold over 20,000 copies.
