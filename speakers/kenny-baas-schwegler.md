Kenny Baas-Schwegler is a strategic software delivery consultant, Sociotechnical architecture, facilitator, collaborate modeller, technical lead that builds quality into software delivery at Xebia. He mentors, coaches and consults management and teams by using practices, techniques and tools from domain-driven design, anthropology, deep democracy, behaviour-driven development, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery.

Through Aikido training, he learned the most efficient way to work together. To get the outcome that all parties want, energy should not be blocked but should be bent and influenced. The philosophy behind this line of reasoning is not only embedded in his personal life, but also in his work life.
By using and combining tools such as EventStorming, Example Mapping, Impact Mapping, and User Story mapping, he helps to bridge the communication gap between business and IT. With these approaches, he aims to create a transparent, safe, and collaborative space with constant and instant feedback for delivering quality software.

Besides his daily work, he also helps organise several meetups for Virtual Domain-Driven Design, Domain Driven Design Nederland and EventStorming Netherlands and is a public speaker giving talks and hands-on workshops at conferences and meetups.
