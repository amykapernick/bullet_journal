Shahid is an independent consultant working with companies to help migrate their existing applications to the Cloud and to build natively for the cloud using technologies such as Kubernetes.
A .NET developer/architect with nearly a decade of experience he is usually happiest working with the latest technologies and playing around with gadgets or talking about cars.
In his spare time he pretends to be a photographer usually picking stunning locations and pressing the shutter button at the right time.
