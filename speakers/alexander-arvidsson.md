Alexander is a principal solutions architect at Atea in Link√∂ping, Sweden. Nobody really knows what it means to be a principal solutions architect, but he spends his days teaching courses or helping clients of all shapes and sizes to take better care of their data.
He has spent the last 20 years toying with data, databases and related infrastructure services such as storage, networking and virtualization, occasionally emerging from the technical darkness to attend a Star Wars convention somewhere in the world.
He is a Data Platform MVP, frequent international speaker, podcaster, Pluralsight author, blogger and a Microsoft Certified Trainer, focusing on SQL Server, Azure and Power BI.
