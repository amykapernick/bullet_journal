Mark is the founder of RendleLabs, which is really just him playing with .NET Core, Docker, Azure, microservices and so on and then teaching other people about it and helping them build clean, stable, scalable solutions. He's been getting paid to do what he loves for nearly 30 years now, and still worries that somebody's going to notice and make him stop.
