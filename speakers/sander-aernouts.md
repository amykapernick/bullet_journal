When I was growing up my father used to say "what his eyes see, his hands will tear apart", I was always opening up remote controls and other devices around our house so that I could see what makes them tick. I was, and still am, a curious lad and later on my curiosity moved towards computers, software development, and now the cloud

Today I still love to know what makes the world tick, but I traded my screwdriver for my keyboard and leave the remote controls alone (most of the time).
