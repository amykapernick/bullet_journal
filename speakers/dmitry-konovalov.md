I am an Russian-Norwegian guy in late 30's obsessed with software engineering and architecture. Through the recent 15 years I worked for different companies, both as a consultant and as a in-house developer. Through the years I gained experience with different tools and frameworks and observed the evolution of hardware and software development.
