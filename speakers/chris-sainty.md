Hey, my name is Chris Sainty. I'm a software engineer, writer, open source contributor andworking in Norfolk, England. I work predominantly on web applications and services using ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.I've been a developer for over 15 years. I started with classic ASP in the late 90's before moving on to Visual Basic 6 for a short period. I was then fortunate that my employer at the time needed someone to investigate a new framework and language from Microsoft called .NET and C#. I volunteered and haven't looked back since.I've worked with ASP.NET WebForms, MVC, WebAPI and Razor Pages. While I work across the full stack, I've always had a strong leaning to frontend development. This lead me to working with the AngularJS framework and later Angular for a time.Most recently (start of 2018), I discovered a new framework from Microsoft calledand it's been my passion ever since. I regularly write articles on Blazor on this blog, forand. I also maintain a set of open source packages for Blazor applications called. As well as interacting with the community as much as possible viaand.When I'm not standing in front of a computer (I invested in a stand up desk and it's amazing!). I play a bit of veterans football (soccer for those in the states), the occasional round of golf and go on long walks with the wife and our dog Bella.
