Don first heard the siren call of the machine emanating from a TRS-80 sometime in the early '80s. His first caretaker was a venerable PDP-7 hidden in a remote coastal outpost. A veteran programmer of a wide variety of projects ranging from high-performance servers delicately handcrafted in C to creaky old desktop applications written in dead frameworks to squeaky-clean mobile applications written using the latest cool tools, Don has a strong interest in nurturing new apprentices into strong journeymen and creating software that astonishes at every level and withstands inspection long after the show has finished. Writing something that seems to work from a superficial inspection is simply not good enough. From initial idea to finished product, each object and function should be a work of art.
