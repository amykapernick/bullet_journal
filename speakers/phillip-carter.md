Phillip is a PM on the .NET team working on F# tooling, the F# language, F# documentation, and .NET project tooling. He wishes he had more time to code, but that doesn't stop him from having fun with people on GitHub. Oh, and he's helping drive the future of .NET and its languages . . . or something like that.
