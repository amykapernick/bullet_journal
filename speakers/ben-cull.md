Ben Cull has left the comfortable consultant lifestyle at SSW Australia for the untamed mountains and treacherous valleys of the startup world with his payments platform, Pinch Payments.

He has extensive experience developing enterprise web solutions, but is now free to apply his efforts to the bleeding edge of today's technologies. He wrestles with Alphas, fights with betas, and reminisces with RTMs so that you don't have to. You can find him talking at conferences around the world about his favourite topics: Payments, Web, and Beer.

Oh boy the beer! If you get caught anywhere near him, you'll definitely get into a discussion about either beer or brewing :)
