The co-founder of HighTech Group, teacher in Kazan Federal University and blogger. Try to google “как писать тесты” (“how to write tests" — in Russian). The first result is his article.

Previously, before founding own company, Maxim was employed as a Web Developer, Team Leader, CTO and Head of Quality Department in various companies from Kazan, Moscow, Saint Petersburgm Russia and Antwerp, Belgium.

He is sure that technology is not a "thing in itself," but tools. The tools must suit the problem being solved. The work of an engineer is to select the right tools and create new ones.
