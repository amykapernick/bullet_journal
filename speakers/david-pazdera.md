Raised and trained as an IT Engineer (aka 'infra guy'), transitioned to a solution architect role (focusing on Azure), now adding development skills, aspiring to become a Cloud Engineer. Passionate about DevOps, "security built-in, not bolted on" and "everything as code" principles. You can find my professional bio atand my AboutMe page at
