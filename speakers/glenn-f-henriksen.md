Glenn F. Henriksen is working as a mentor, evangelist and developer in Stavanger, Norway. Here he gets to explore new tools, processes and technologies and continuously improve how he and his fellow developers work with code, tasks and projects. He has been a Microsoft Development MVP, a part of the Microsoft Regional Director program and is an Azure Advisor. In the past 18 years he has co-owned a company, worked as a manager, support, network admin, developer, architect, technical lead and more, but his favorite thing is still swapping code for food.
