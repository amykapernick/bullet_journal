Enrico is a freelance programmer, teacher and mentor with a strong passion for acquiring and sharing knowledge. If allowed, he’ll happily talk for hours about software quality, the DevOps culture, the history of personal computing or mechanical keyboards. One topic he’s particularly fond of is Git, which, as he discovered, combines two of his other great passions: the Unix philosophy and source code history.When it comes to teaching, Enrico speaks regularly at conferences and user groups, delivers workshops and produces online courses for Pluralsight.He occasionally manages to do some open source work by contributing to AutoFixture—a .NET library for generating test data during unit testing—and by maintaining Cake.Curl, an addin for Cake that lets you invoke curl from a build script.Enrico can be found online on his website ator on Twitter at @ecampidoglio.
