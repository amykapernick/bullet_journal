Programmer, retired mage, bookworm, storyteller and liberal arts devotee.

I'm into language semantics, its understanding and impact on the way people think. I love both natural and programming languages - professionally my heart belongs to Java, but I cheat on her with Python, Scala and, occasionally, other beautiful languages. In addition to my work at TomTom as a software engineer a I'm keen on artificial intelligence, mainly for natural language understanding. If we are to reach technological singularity, we better get on it!
