Craig is freelance trainer and architect that focuses on bringing together the WordPress and non-WordPress worlds through the use of Web Components.

He is based in Brighton and attends the local WordUp meetings. With a previous career in business and accounting, as well as having run his own non-IT business, Craig can speak both technical and business. He believes that technology serves the user, not the other way around, so the user experience is paramount.

He has started to speak at events and is interested in Web Components, Progressive Web Apps and Google AMP and has a developing interest in pages that are ‘instant’ and/or offline capable.
