Eirik is a developer with a keen interest in popular psychology. One of the things that interests him the most is team culture, and understanding how a good working environment can help make people better coders and eager to come to work every day. Eirik would like to call himself a full-stack developer, but the truth is, he spends most of his working hours developing front-end code. With barely two years in the industry, Eirik still has much to learn and jumps on any opportunity to expand his understanding.
