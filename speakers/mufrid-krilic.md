Senior Software Developer/Coach at DIPS, Norway, leading software house for healthcare domain in Norway.

I have 18 years of software developer experience, in telecom and healthcare, thus being deeply involved in developing enterprise-solutions in complex domains. The major part of the last 10 years of my professional career has been devoted to leading and coaching different development teams, by cultivating knowledge sharing in the organization and increasing co-developerâ€™s business understanding. Currently I am involved as a developer and coach of a new team responsible for a mission-critical legacy system as well as trying to introduce Domain-Driven Design and build technical coaching culture on a higher, organization-wide level.

Apart from work I enjoy spending time engaging my kids in STEM activities. I am an enthusiastic First Lego League mentor and have actively contributed to the FIRST community locally and internationally.
