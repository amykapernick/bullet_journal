The passion for programming and making new discoveries took me from unlocking the secrets of C=64 machine language to all things web. Today, after 20 years of professional experience, the sheer excitement and pride of making a new technologies "work" is still driving me every day.I've worked on various domains in different industries (e-government, fixed-odds betting, online gaming, social networks, investment banking) and with different technology stacks. Designed and helped building several scalable, high-throughput, low-latency transaction processing systems. One of the founding fathers of MindMup.Today, I'm helping ambitious teams achieve their goals and improve how they build software.Regularly giving talks at various meetups and software development conferences.
