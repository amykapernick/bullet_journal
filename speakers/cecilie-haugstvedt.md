Cecilie is a Test Lead at SOCO with a technical background. She's been working with test in both the public and private sector for the last couple of years and likes to share her ideas at conferences.

Cecilie believes the quality of the system is the responsibility of the entire team and not something you leave to testers alone. She loves working in agile teams, is a proponent of automating all manual processes, and has a special interest in making applications accessible for all.
