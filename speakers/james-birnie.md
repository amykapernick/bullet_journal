James has been working on commercial software since the late 1990s. Back then TDD was something you studied but never did, pipelines were something that carried oil and Agile and Lean were words used to describe athletes. In 2006 he joined a startup and worked there for 9 years which included major rewrites, cloud migration and Agile transformation.

In 2015 he started a new life as a transformation consultant and now he enjoys working with a variety of clients trying to effect real organisational change by focusing on software craft, DevOps culture, a belief in outcomes over processes and above all, a relentless drive to improve.
