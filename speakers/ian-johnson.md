Ian is a software developer working at Redgate, a company that develops tools for developers and database administrators.

Ian is passionate about writing maintainable code that delivers on the needs of users. Though he considers himself an introvert, Ian loves talking with other developers, learning from their experiences and sharing his own.

Outside of work, Ian is a passionate Star Wars fan and has been known to make the occasional really bad pun, but all of his code is "no-pun sourced" (sorry, couldn't resist).
